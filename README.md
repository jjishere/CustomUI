CustomUI
========

An iOS custom UI that helps you to draw line, circle, custom label and etc..

Often time I encouter situation where I have to draw a simple circle or a line. I don't want to use graphics to increase my app size and decrease my performance.
So I normally draw out the circle or a line using a code.

To make my life easier, I created a framework myself to help me to do those tedious things. Which saved me a lot of times.

I am sharing this iOS framework to anyone who needs custom circle, line, label, view and etc... Happy Coding!!
